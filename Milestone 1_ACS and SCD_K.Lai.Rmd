## Overview and Motivation

This project originated as part of my collaborations with hematologists and infectious disease physicians at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta. We have conducted several studies related to infectious diseases in our pediatric sickle cell disease (SCD) population, so this project is the next in line and one that I can take on as the primary author. As an epidemiologist, I have spent most of my career in the infectious disease arena, but recently have started working on SCD. This project marries my two subject matter foci while fulfilling my epidemiologic curiosity around how differnet viruses may affect vulnerable populations differently. 

## Project Objectives

The primary objective of this project is to describe any associations between viral infections and acute chest syndrome in our popoulation of pediatric SCD patients. 

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
